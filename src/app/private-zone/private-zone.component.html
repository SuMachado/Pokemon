      It may be entry #112 in the Pokédex, but according to Ken
      Sugimori – the primary designer for the Pokémon games – Rhydon was the first Pokémon ever created. This is
      also the reason why sprites of Rhydon were so widespread in the original games. In that same interview,
      Sugimori mentions Lapras and Clefairy as some of the other earliest Pokémon designs to join Rhydon.

    <h2>2. Pokémon Means 'Pocket Monsters'</h2>
    <p>
      Pokémon is an abbreviation of 'Poketto Monsutā' which means 'Pocket Monster' in Japanese. Because they fit
      in your pocket, of course! Although luckily they live in Poke balls, imagine the mess if they used your
      pockets as a loo...

    <h2>3. Pikachu Directly Translates as 'Sparkly Mouse Noise'</h2>
    <p>
      If you ever wondered where the Pokémon names come from, Pikachu is a good example of how random they can be.
      'Pika' is from 'Pikapika' which means 'glitter or sparkle' and 'chu' is from 'chuchu' the noise a mouse
      makes. Put them together and you have Sparkle Mouse Noise! For some reason. Pikachu is a sort of mouse,
      right?

    <h2>4. Lots of Pokémon Names are Puns</h2>
    <p>
      For example, the powers of Mimikyu are literally to 'mimic you'. And Sudowoodo? 'Psudo wood', or fake wood. Squirtle is a reference to the fact that he's a turtle who can squirt water, and Charmander is so-called
      because it's a fire Pokémon which can 'char' you. Which other clever names can you spot?

    <h2>5. Original Pokémon Names</h2>
    <p>
      In the Pokémon Red and Pokémon Blue beta, some Pokémon had distinctly different names than what we know them as now. For example, Koffing and Weezing were named Ny and La respectively to represent the polluted air in New York and Los Angeles. Kabuto and Kabutops were named Att and Lantis respectively as a reference to Atlantis. Jigglypuff and Wigglytuff had the adorable names of
      Pudding and Custard. And Gyarados had the much cooler name of Skulkraken.

    <h2>6. The 'Gotta Catch 'Em All' Ethos Has a Back Story</h2>
    <p>
      Satoshi's idea about collecting animals in Pokémon came from his love of being in the garden as a child. As a boy, he would spend hours finding and collecting bugs and insects. In fact, he spent so much time doing it, his friends called him 'Dr. Bug', and he originally wanted to become a bug scientist - or entomologist, to give it its proper name. We're glad he decided to work in video games instead!

    <h2>7. Only Mario has Sold More Video Games than Pokémon</h2>
    <p>
      Pokémon is VERY popular. In fact, last year, over 20 years since it first came out, Pokémon was still the best-selling game! It's not hard to see why - the endless types of Pokémon and scenarios mean Pokémon has a lot to offer!

    <h2>8. The Colors of the Pokeballs are Actually Based on Campbell's Soup Cans</h2>
    <p>
      Yes, you read right, the famous Pokéball is actually meant to mimic the look of a soup can! Specifically, the tomato soup cans that appear in Andy Warhol's famous picture. We're not sure why the design was based on a soup can, but once you see it, you can't unsee it!

    <h2>9. Ash's Pokémon was Originally Meant to be a Clefairy, Not Pikachu!</h2>
    <p>
      It's hard to imagine anyone else as Ash's best pal, but the original plan was to make it a Clefairy! It's easy to see why, like Pikachu, Clefairies are cute, small, and portable, but 'Detective Clefairy' just doesn't have the same ring to it.

    <h2>10. Ash's Japanese Name is Satoshi</h2>
    <p>
      In the original Japanese, Ash is called Satoshi, like the game designer who created him (Satoshi Tajiri). We can see why he identifies with Ash; not only is Ash the main character, he's also an honest, loyal friend, and both he and Satoshi love finding weird creatures to collect!

    <h2>11. Over 88 Billion Pokémon Caught on Pokémon Go</h2>
    <p>
      That's a lot of Pokémon! Between millions of different people of course - no one person has caught that many! In fact, it's basically impossible to 'Catch 'Em All' since some Pokémon don't actually appear in the game, especially some of the rarer or older ones. It's fun trying to find them though!

    <h2>12. Nearly 1,000 Different Species of Pokémon</h2>
    <p>
      Split into 18 different categories, there are nearly 1,000 total different species of Pokémon out there! Originally, there were just 151 (although that's still a lot!) but over time the number has grown and grown to a current total of 898, and there are more to be discovered!

    <h2>13. 'Splash' Move Usually Means 'Hop' Instead</h2>
    <p>
      'Splash' is Magikarp's signature move. But it doesn't necessarily involve water. In fact, when you 'splash' on land, you mostly just flop about. It's not a very intimidating move, we have to admit. Splash is a bit of a joke move that shows just how useless Magikarp can be on the battlefield. The move was originally called 'Splash' because only Magikarp used it, but as time went on, the splash move (originally called 'hop' in Japanese) can also be used by non-water Pokémon in non-water environments. So, next time you see a non-water Pokémon 'splash', now you know what it actually means!
